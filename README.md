# Recreate-Landing-Page-Flutterwave

In order to hone and keep my Frontend skills sharp i have decided to Recreate at least a page from some of my best websites from time to time. 
I have decided to start with Flutterwave one of Nigeria and Africa's first payment processing platforms. I recreated their official 
landing page for their website using HTML/CSS and a likkle JavaScript. I have only recreated the desktop view for now, media queries for 
other screen sizes will be created later on as i am chanced.
